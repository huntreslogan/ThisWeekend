With his turbo-charged new Alligator Records album,\xa0The Devil You Know, Castro strips his music down to its raw essence as he rockets into the next phase of his storied career.</P>\r\n<P>The Devil You Know, recorded in the Bay Area with his fiery new band The Painkillers and produced by Castro and Bonnie Hayes, is a contemporary blues tour-de-force. The album is an untamed, high-energy set of 13 songs, including nine written or co-written by Castro. \u201cFor the new album I challenged myself\xa0to add different sounds and new rhythms to my style while remaining true to my roots. I wrote using ideas for songs and ideas for sounds together in a way I\u2019d never done before,\u201d explains Castro, \u201cusing drum rhythms to drive the lyrics.\u201d The tracks\u2014melodic and biting, energetic and fun\u2014are brought to life with sonic authority by bassist Randy McDonald (from the original Tommy Castro Band), keyboardist James Pace and original Painkillers drummer Byron Cage.</P>\r\n<P>In addition, many of Castro\u2019s friends and admirers, including Alligator label-mates Marcia Ball and The Holmes Brothers, add their talents to the proceedings. Other guests include guitarists Joe Bonamassa and Mark Karan, guitarist/vocalist Tab Benoit, vocalists Samantha Fish and Tasha Taylor and harmonica player Magic Dick. Each song comes loaded with emotional depth and muscular hooks courtesy of Castro\u2019s soulful singing, insightful lyrics and dynamic, potent guitar playing. WithThe Devil You Know, Castro\u2014The Painkillers blazing behind him\u2014unleashes an instant classic.
